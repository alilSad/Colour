Submission for the colour challenge

The product is an animated image which has all 32768 unique pixels, where every frame it generates again randomly.

Made with Javascript and p5.js 

To run, open the index.html in your browser.

This program generates a random 15 bit colour and pushes it to an array, which is then used to assign a colour to each pixel. The draw function is a part of p5.js and it continuously executes, which is how the image looks animated.
